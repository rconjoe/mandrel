The JSON request model required by microservice.py is as follows:\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"auction_id\": int,\\n    \"item_name\": str,\\n    \"minimum_bid\": float,\\n    \"start_time\": int,\\n    \"end_time\": int,\\n    \"bids\": [\\n        {\\n            \"user_id\": int,\\n            \"bid_amount\": float\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n2. To generate a playground for the microservice AuctionBiddingExecutor6878298, you need to replace the placeholders in the app_template.py file with the correct values. Here\\'s how you can do it:\\n\\n- Replace `<page title here>` with the title of your page.\\n- Replace `<page icon here>` with the URL of the icon you want to use for your page.\\n- Replace `<thematic emoji here>` with an emoji that represents the theme of your microservice.\\n- Replace `<header title here>` with the title of your microservice.\\n- Replace `<10 word description here>` with a brief description of your microservice.\\n- Replace `<a unique thematic emoji here>` with an emoji that represents the theme of your input parameters (if any).\\n- Replace `<sub header title here>` with the title of your input parameters (if any).\\n- Define your input parameters inside the `with st.form(key=\"input_form\"):` block.\\n- Replace `<submit button text>` with the text you want to display on your submit button.\\n- Replace `<spinner text here>` with the text you want to display while your microservice is processing the input.\\n- Replace `<visualization of results here>` with the code that visualizes the results of your microservice.\\n- Replace `<escaped_input_json_dict_string>` with the escaped version of your input JSON dictionary string in the curl command section.\\n\\nOnce you have replaced all the placeholders, save the file as app.py and run it using the following command:\\n```\\nstreamlit run app.py\\n```\\nThis will launch your microservice playground in your browser.' additional_kwargs={}"
